# Dog-Vision
This Dog Breed Identification model was created by me as a part of learning Machine Learning. This model utilizes several concepts of deep and transfer learning and utilizes tensorflow library and keras. This model trains on a huge dataset of dog images and creates a regression equation to predict dog breeds based on various features etc.
